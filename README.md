How to set up a repo and file structure for automatic build, test, documentation and deployment.

## The most simple approach (__init__.py only, no setup.py)
See the example files in `simple_packages/`. Run `pytest`from that directory and also run `my_package/script.py` separately. Everything should work.  

Adding a `__init__.py` file to a directory, turns it into a package. Files in that directory can then be imported from *outside the package* using a statement like the below:  
`from my_package.my_module import my_function`. Typically from sibling directories like `test`. 
*Within* the package, only use from `pymodule import function_name`.
Make sure the folder doesn't have the same name as an existing package, e.g. `code`.

## The setup.py

**TBD: setup-fila, hva gj√∏r packages=(...) og name()**

Since we are using `tox`, it is recommended to use the [src layout](https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/05/25/python-packaging/#the-structure).  


`__init__.py` files in all **(?)** folders under the top folder.  
`from folder.folder.module import function1, function2` To import from a project sibling folder. Within a folder, just `from .module ...`
